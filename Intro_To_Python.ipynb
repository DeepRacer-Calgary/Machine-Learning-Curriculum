If you have not used Python or any language whatsoever, this section is for you. To begin I will ask that you install Pycharm on your computer [use this link to install the free community version of Pycharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/download/#section=mac). All done? Great! Now we move on to your first few coding exercises."

If those two things match (str = str), then it will use the same print statement as before.
