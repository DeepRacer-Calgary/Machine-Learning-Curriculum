To begin I will ask that you install Pycharm on your computer [use this link to install the free community version of Pycharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/download/#section=mac). All done? Great! Now we move on to your first few coding exercises."

        "Time to analyze this. First, we assign \"i\" a value of 100 to begin the song. Then we create a while loop so that we don't have to write 200 lines of text manually (that takes way too long to do!). In our while loop we say that the codition to stay in it is that the value of i must be bigger than 0. If \"i\" becomes 0 then the conditon to stay in the loop is no longer satisfied and so we leave the loop and end the program (using your knowledge of Python operators can you think of another way to write that condition?). Using the same style of printing variables as before, we then print out the lyrics of the song. One thing to note is in the second print line (I have separated it into two different print statements and used the newline character \"\\n\" to show the different ways to create a new line, but you can do all of this in one print statement, I'll leave this as another exercise) we use \"i-1\" as the new variable to put in the string, but looking at this through Python's debugger (Create a breakpoint by clicking just to the left of the line you want to stop at and click the play button with a bug in it to use the debugger) we'll see that this doesn't change the value of \"i\", any guesses why?\n",
        "\n",
        "Now in the last line of the loop the line \"i -= 1\" was used. This is a shorthand way of writing the line \"i = i - 1\", which tells Python to replace the value currently in \"i\" with a value that is 1 less than \"i\" (an example is if i = 20 then 20 - 1 = 19 so the new \"i\" would be 19). This line is very important because if it isn't there then we would have just made an infinite loop that will never stop!"

Remember that you can put these statements within each other and that indenting will put a statement within the scope of a loop or conditional statement. I will create another file with answers to all the questions I have posed in this tutorial and a possible solution to this final exercise (as a hint to make it look nicer, you can use [, end=\"  \"] at the end of a print statement). Using Google isn't cheating, the point of this is to help you understand the different things you can do with basic Python statements. Good Luck!"
