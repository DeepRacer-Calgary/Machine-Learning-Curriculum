# Machine Learning Curriculum
A proposed Curriculum to guide people into understanding the fundamentals of Machine Learning and prepare them for Reinforcement Learning

## Section 1 - The Basics:
Episodes 1 & 2 of Grant Sanderson's series on neural networks is a thorough and concise introduction to what the purpose of machine learning is, how it works, and most importantly, how to understand it.

If you would like to go more in depth than that then go ahead and complete the series, but in my opinion, these are the best videos for the time commitment. That will be my philosophy though this tutorial, but if you want more materials for a better understanding, we will have those too: [Complete Playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLZHQObOWTQDNU6R1_67000Dx_ZCJB-3pi)


## Section 2 - Types of Math used in Artificial Intelligence:

Machine learning like everything you learn in university, is a tool. It is a very powerful tool, but a tool nonetheless. You wouldn't use a sledgehammer when you need a saw, or even a smaller hand tool.

You will likely encounter problem where you think: "Can this be solved by machine learning?" and the answer is often yes... but. Another question you should ask is *should* you use machine learning?

Here are some statistical tool you can use not only instead of machine learning, but also in addition to it:

⋅⋅* [Regression Analysis](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vPde9bYrr80&ab_channel=CLOSER) - A tool most often used to find the equation relating many **linearly** related variables

⋅⋅* [Singular Value Decomposition](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gXbThCXjZFM&ab_channel=SteveBrunton) - This is a personal favorite of mine. The singular value decomposition (or SVD) is a tool often used with very *very* large datasets. It finds the "Principle Components" of that data from which every other component is made, much like the Fourier Transform finds underlying frequencies in a signal.
